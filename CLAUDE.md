# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

Quadrantology is a **personality tracker** and card game website at **quadrantology.com**. It models organizational creative destruction through 6 archetypes in two groups: Exit (Hacker, Contrarian, Legalist) and Voice (Investigator, Holy Warrior, Operator), mapped onto a master 2×2 framework called "Death and Taxes" with 13 sub-models.

The core product is a logbook-based personality tracker, not a one-shot test. Users take the questionnaire multiple times over a period (minimum 3 runs over 90 days), building a logbook of results with journal entries. The trend across runs — the personality arc — is the primary result. See `DESIGN.md` for design principles and `DATAMODEL.md` for the full data model.

Access is a paid service: users take the test free, then pay or enter an access code to view results. Three product tiers are planned: single assessment sequence, annual subscription, and Coach Mode. Access codes come in three types: `personal` (generated on Stripe purchase), `coupon` (batch-generated promos), and `org` (bulk org purchases). All code management is in Cloudflare D1.

**Privacy principle:** we sell access (codes), not data. Sharing and aggregation are always user-initiated. We do not build data-collection tooling for orgs.

## Deployment

Two separate deploy targets — **do not confuse them**:

| Target | URL | Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare Pages | `quadrantology.pages.dev` | `master` | Active development |
| GitHub Pages | `quadrantology.com` | `gh-pages` | Stable production (pre-CF DNS cutover) |

### Cloudflare Pages (active development)
- Deploys automatically on push to `master` — no build step
- Pages Functions in `functions/api/` deploy automatically alongside
- D1 database: `quadrantology` (bound as `DB` in CF Pages → Settings → Functions)
- `quadrantology.com` will point here after DNS cutover

### GitHub Pages (stable, `quadrantology.com` via current DNS)
- Serves from the `gh-pages` branch at `/docs`
- `gh-pages` branch = snapshot at tag `ghpages-v1` (last clean build before CF migration)
- **Do not push new features here** — this is the frozen stable build for current DNS
- To update: cherry-pick specific commits onto `gh-pages`, or advance the branch intentionally

### DNS cutover plan (when ready)
1. Point `quadrantology.com` DNS to Cloudflare Pages
2. Disable GitHub Pages in repo settings (or leave as fallback)
3. Update Stripe webhook URL to `quadrantology.com/api/stripe-webhook`

### Local preview
```bash
python3 -m http.server -d docs
```
Worker-dependent features (Stripe, code validation) require `wrangler pages dev`.

## Backend

### API routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET  /api/price` | Live price from Stripe (so UI always matches product) |
| `POST /api/validate-code` | Check code validity + remaining uses |
| `POST /api/consume-code` | Decrement use counter (called after results shown) |
| `POST /api/checkout` | Create Stripe Checkout session |
| `GET  /api/session-code?session_id=` | Exchange Stripe session_id for personal code |
| `POST /api/stripe-webhook` | Handle payment events, generate personal code |
| `GET  /api/questions` | Serve live+calibrating questions from D1 |
| `GET  /api/admin/challenge` | Issue ECDSA auth nonce |
| `POST /api/admin/auth` | Verify ECDSA signature, return HMAC session token |
| `GET  /api/admin/questions` | List all questions (with optional `?id=Q001` for single+state log) |
| `POST /api/admin/questions` | Create or update question |
| `GET  /api/admin/research-data` | Response counts + archetype breakdown (`?question_id=` or `?all=1`) |
| `POST /api/admin/generate-codes` | Batch-generate coupon/org codes |
| `POST /api/research/record-response` | Store anonymised per-run response (opted-in users) |
| `POST /api/research/submit-logbook` | Store anonymised full logbook history (bulk opt-in) |

### D1 schema (`worker/schema.sql`)

Tables: `codes`, `questions`, `question_state_log`, `research_subjects`, `research_sessions`, `research_responses`, `admin_challenges`

**`codes`** (unchanged)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | TEXT PK | Format: `QNTLG-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` |
| `type` | TEXT | `personal` / `coupon` / `org` |
| `total_uses` | INTEGER | Runs purchased/granted |
| `used_uses` | INTEGER | Incremented on each result view |
| `org_id` | TEXT | Org name or promo label |
| `label` | TEXT | Human label; stores email for personal codes |
| `stripe_session_id` | TEXT | For personal codes from Stripe |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp |

### Environment variables (CF Pages → Settings → Environment variables)

| Name | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Secret | Stripe API secret (`sk_test_...` or `sk_live_...`) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret | Stripe webhook signing secret (`whsec_...`) |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` | Secret | Price ID for the access product (`price_...`) |
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Secret | Bearer token for `/api/admin/generate-codes` |
| `ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEYS` | Plain | Comma-separated base64url SPKI ECDSA P-256 public keys for admin UI (`/admin/questions`). Generate via the admin page key setup flow. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN_SECRET` | Secret | HMAC-SHA256 signing secret for admin session tokens. Must be at least 32 bytes of random entropy. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. |

### D1 schema migrations

Schema changes are applied manually. After updating `worker/schema.sql`, run:
```bash
wrangler d1 execute quadrantology --file=worker/schema.sql --remote
```
This is safe to re-run (all statements use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`).

To seed questions into D1 from the static file (first-time setup):
```bash
wrangler d1 execute quadrantology --file=worker/seed-questions.sql --remote
```
After seeding, the admin UI at `/admin/questions` can import/manage questions from D1. The "Import from questions.json" button in the admin UI also handles seeding.

## Data Model

See `DATAMODEL.md` for the full canonical spec. Summary below for quick reference.

### Questions (D1-backed, schema v2)

Questions are now managed in D1 via `/admin/questions` and served via `GET /api/questions`. The static `docs/data/questions.json` is a seed/backup file only.

Each question has: `id` (Q001–Q028+), `status` (`live`/`calibrating`/`archived`), `response_weight` (float, default 1.0), `questions_version` (int), `answer_a`/`answer_b`, `weights_a`/`weights_b` (dimension weight arrays), `notes`, and `state_log` (full status change history).

Status meanings:
- `live` — in the test pool for respondents
- `calibrating` — live AND anonymous responses are recorded in D1 for research
- `archived` — not in pool; preserved for history replay (questions are never deleted)

Calibration threshold (`protocol.json > calibration.min_samples`, default 100): after this many responses, `response_weight` can be manually set via admin UI.

Dimensions (index order): `[exit, voice, virtue, consequentialist, deontological]`

**Known issues to resolve:** Q011 answer A and Q023 answer B have all-zero weight vectors. May be intentional asymmetric questions — review with author.

### Own run records

Two versions coexist in localStorage and exported JSON:

**v1** (legacy): `{ version:1, timestamp, archetype, evBias, scores:[array], answers:[array] }`

**v2** (current): `{ version:2, timestamp, questions_version, run:[{qid,ans}], scores:{exit,voice,virtue,consequentialist,deontological}, position:{ev, ethics:{virtue,consequentialist,deontological}}, archetype, ev_bias, calibrating:[qids], run_token:string|null, note:'' }`

- `position.ev`: continuous E↔V position, -1 (pure Voice) to +1 (pure Exit)
- `position.ethics`: simplex proportions summing to 1.0
- `run`: exact question IDs + answers, enabling future replay and reanalysis
- `calibrating`: array of question IDs that were in `calibrating` status at run time (used by `submit-logbook` to correctly tag `is_calibrating` on response rows)
- `run_token`: 32-char hex token generated at run time if user opted into research; stored in `research_sessions.run_token` for cross-dataset linkage. `null` if user declined. Never the same as the internal `session_id`.
- `note`: freeform journal entry, private to the user, never included in share payloads

### Personal Circle records

Stored alongside own runs. Each entry is a point-in-time snapshot received from another person's share URL. Up to `personal_circle.max_slots` entries (currently 8, see `docs/data/protocol.json`).

```
{
  version: "circle-v1",
  added:   <ISO timestamp when added to circle>,
  name:    <string, as set by the sharer>,
  results: [
    { ts, archetype, ev, ethics:[virtue, consequentialist, deontological] },
    ...  // up to 3 entries, newest first
  ]
}
```

- `results` contains summary data only — no Q/A run data, no journal notes
- `ethics` is an array of proportions summing to 1.0 (virtue, consequentialist, deontological)
- To update: user pastes a new share URL into that person's slot; `added` timestamp refreshes
- Requires subscription to add entries; receiving and viewing a share URL is free

### Share URL payload

Generated client-side from own logbook when user clicks "Share my arc". Requires `min_runs_to_share` completed runs (currently 3). Fragment format: `r.html#v1:<base64url-deflate-json>`.

```
{
  v:    1,
  name: <string, editable by sharer before generating>,
  results: [
    { ts, archetype, ev, ethics:[virtue, consequentialist, deontological] },
    ...  // most recent 3 own runs
  ]
}
```

Never sent to the server. Decoded and rendered entirely in `r.html`. Journal notes and full Q/A data are never included.

### localStorage keys

| Key | Content |
|---|---|
| `quadrantology_name` | User's display name |
| `quadrantology_code` | Access code (personal/coupon/org) |
| `quadrantology_history` | JSON array of own run records (newest first, v1+v2) |
| `quadrantology_circle` | JSON array of Personal Circle entries (circle-v1, up to 8) |

### Downloaded logbook JSON

Top-level fields: `_note`, `name`, `code`, `history` (own runs), `circle` (Personal Circle snapshots). The code is flagged in the note so users know to keep the file secure. Circle data is included so the full relational context is portable across devices.

## Architecture Notes

- All pages share `quadrantology.css` and the same nav structure (CSS-only hamburger menu, checkbox trick)
- System font stack, no external JS dependencies
- Nav: The Test | The Theory | Shop | How to Play | Archetypes (dropdown)
- Color scheme: bg `#f4f1eb`, card `#ffffff`, text `#2c2c2c`, accent `#c0713a`, exit `#3a7a8c` (teal), voice `#8c3a3a` (deep red)
- Test flow: name intro → questions → compute results → check localStorage for code → paywall if none → results + journal entry → save to logbook
- Price shown in UI is fetched live from Stripe `/api/price` so it always matches the product
- Feature thresholds (min runs, circle size, etc.) are in `docs/data/protocol.json` — read at runtime, never hardcode
- See `DATAMODEL.md` before adding any feature that touches stored data
